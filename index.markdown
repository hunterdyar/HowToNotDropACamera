# Start Here: Don't Drop Things

## Camera
1. Do not move your feet while looking through the viewfinder. _Your field of view is different, the top of those stairs may be closer than they appear_.
2. Do not fiddle with the battery/SD Card doors when out and about.
3. Do not throw your camera onto a couch cushion like an old phone.
2. Connections (USB/Charging cable, HDMI cable, etc) are **not** straps, are not secure points of contact.
2. Store your camera in an appropriately safe, padded, and secure area. They make bags just for cameras, they're great. Probably better than your current bag, tbh.
3. Do not look directly into the sun. Please.

## Lens
3. Do not constantly remove and replace your lens cap while shooting. Just leave it in your pocket, it's fine.
3. Do not leave your lens pointed at the sun (upright on a sunny day). It's a magnifying glass, and the expensive part of your cameras is a poor ant. _This is when you use the lens cap_. 
2. Default to using a Haze or UV filter on the front of your lens. It's like a clear lens cap. What a concept!
3. A little bit of dust on the front of the lens is probably fine. Perfect optical clarity should not be a priority concern while you are photographing. _It's probably so out of focus, it's not there, just watch your flares._
2. Clean your lens when you have time and space and a table and are not at the beach surrounded by sand.
3. Only clean your lens with an appropriate microfiber cloth, and do not blow disgusting bacteria-filled moist lung-air on your image sensor for the love of all things decent.
3. Never directly touch the electrical contacts with your gross oily skin. 

## Camera Strap
1. Use your camera strap.
2. I'm serious. Actually use it. I find neck straps uncomfortable, and have recommendations for other kinds of straps. Find one you like and will actually use.
2. Test that your camera strap is secured properly before gravity tests it for you.
3. Never leave your strap hanging over the edge of a table. _A very expensive cat toy_.
3. Don't let your camera swing about. Keep a steady hand on it. Hold it if you're running. _Wait, I mean don't run with a camera._

## Tripods
1. Don't walk around with your camera on a tripod slung over your shoulder. At least also hold the strap, please.
2. Tripod leg pivots should be tight enough that the legs don't swing inward freely. If the tripod tips forward, and the raised leg swings inward, it can prevent the tripod from regaining it's balance.
3. When panning tripod, always loosen the panning lock, and don't accidentally loosen/unscrew the tripod from the plate. The cameras orientation on the plate should not be adjustable - that's just unscrewing the thing.
3. On uneven terrain, aim to make your center-column vertical by shortening one of the tripod legs.
3. Stand in between two of the legs. Don't straddle a tripod leg.
3. Standing like that lets you have the cameras lens positioned over the third leg. The cameras center-of-balance is generally a bit forward (there's this heavy lens thing). Stick a tripod leg under that.
4. Only loosen one adjustment knob at a time.
5. Give the camera and tripod a little wiggle check.
5. Don't leave it unattended. Even if you've done everything right, some idiot tourist with a big backpack is going to turn and knock it over for you.
4. Know which knob loosens the ball head (it's the big one) and which one adjusts the ball-head-knob-tension. Use the right one.

# Becoming A Photographer

## Feedback Loops
This website aims to arm you with the knowledge to let you teach yourself photography. In other words, this website does not aim to teach you photography. Not directly. It's about giving you insight that allows you to look at an image, and think "hmm, _xyz_ isn't working... what if I tried _abc_".

There's two things happening there. The _xyz_ - understanding how images work, what makes a good image, and so on; and the _abc_ - understanding how cameras work, and what adjustments might affect the image in what way. With that knowledge, plus not dropping the dang things, you have a feedback loop.

Take a photo, look at it, change something, and take another photo. Call it the scientific method, call it the creative process, or just call it a feedback loop. Regardless, it's the knowledge you need to experiment, play, practice, learn, and engage with photography without relying on luck.

## Raise Your Floor
"Not Dropping Cameras" is not just good advise. It's an approach to photography, it's about what programmers call the [pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/). Have a workflow that makes it really hard to mess up, and is mostly focusing at preventing the bad stuff, not focused directly on just getting the good stuff.

The most basic goal, then, is to simply not drop the camera. If you go out, and take photos, and come back with your gear un-dropped, you have succeeded at photography. Congratulations! You're a photographer. Now... we can slowly raise our standards.

> In other words, focus on raising your skill floor, not your skill ceiling.

I believe that being a photographer isn't really about capturing those once-in-a-lifetime images. It's about taking pretty-good, half-decent, gets-the-job-done photos every single time you pick up a camera. Your goal should be to be able to leave with something nice - even when you're tired, unfocused, nothing is working right, the lighting is awful, and the client won't stop badgering you.

## Have an extra battery
Have an extra battery. That's basically it. Having an extra battery means being able to swap to a juiced-up one when your camera dies, and charge the dead one while you continue shooting. Never wait for a battery to charge again. 

## Know when not to trust your gear
You should know your equipment inside and out, as much as possible. For example, you should know how your autofocus works. Know when it will likely work well, and when it will likely not get the job done. Knowing your cameras limitations will keep you from being frustrated and annoyed when shooting. Less surprises is a happier photographer. Plus, counter-intuitively, this knowledge can help prevent you from trying to drop too much money on the empty-promises of the latest-and-greatest gear. 

When professional photographers talk to each other about their gear, they are almost always talking about where it falls short. It won't sound like it at first, but this is how they express their pleasure with the equipment.
